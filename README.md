# Custom-AI-GPT---Route-Management-and-Optimization
Need a OpenAI / Chat GPT that can plan efficient routes for eight teams using a list of addresses.
Each team's route starts a particular office location and ends there at the end of the day.
It prioritizes optimizing the routes based on time windows (AM, PM, or Anytime), required stop durations, and minimizing overall travel time. The 'Anytime' option means the stop can be scheduled in either the AM or PM slots. The GPT ensures routes avoid long distances between stops and balances travel and stop times evenly across all eight teams. The user provides a list of addresses, desired stop times (AM, PM, or Anytime), and stop durations. In response, the GPT delivers an optimized stop list for each team, including the office as the first and last stop, and estimated travel times between each stop. For each address, a properly formatted Google Maps link is provided using the format: 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=ADDRESS'. The list is organized by team rather than stop windows. Additionally, the GPT provides a summary under each team’s route, including total stop time and total travel time. A Google Maps link is added after each address in the list. If inputs are unclear, the GPT makes reasonable assumptions but asks for clarification for key details like address accuracy or critical time windows.
We are looking for a talented developer to create a GPT-driven system to plan efficient routes for eight teams using a list of addresses. The system should be capable of:
• Starting and ending each team's route at the office location: N90W17051 Appleton Ave, Menomonee Falls, WI 53051.
• Optimizing routes based on time windows (AM, PM, or Anytime), required stop durations, and minimizing overall travel time.
• Ensuring 'Anytime' stops can be scheduled in either the AM or PM slots.
• Avoiding long distances between stops and evenly balancing travel and stop times across all eight teams.
• Delivering an optimized stop list for each team, including the office as the first and last stop, with estimated travel times between each stop.
• Providing properly formatted Google Maps links for each address using the format: '[URL]'.
• Organizing the list by team rather than stop windows and including a summary under each team's route, detailing total stop time and total travel time.
If inputs are unclear, the system should make reasonable assumptions but seek clarification for key details like address accuracy or critical time windows.
======================
Python script for the requested route planning system. The solution leverages Google Maps API for calculating distances and durations between stops, integrates user-provided details about addresses and time slots, and organizes outputs accordingly.
Prerequisites

    Google Maps API Key: Obtain an API key from Google Cloud Console.
    Required Libraries: Install googlemaps and pandas.

    pip install googlemaps pandas
